"""Structured decisions in front of a vLLM DiffusionGemma server.

POST /v1/systemone takes Jev's request body: {"model", "state", "questions"}.
"questions" maps an id to {"type", "instructions", "criteria"}, where "type"
is "noul", "choice" or "score" and the criteria shape follows the type:
  noul:   optional {"true": ..., "false": ...} descriptions
  choice: option name -> description or null
  score:  ordered list of levels
Answers take Jev's shapes, with this server's diagnostics alongside:
  noul:   {"noul": p, "probabilities": {"true", "false"}, "confidence"}
  choice: {"choice", "probabilities", "confidence"}
  score:  {"score", "legend", "probabilities", "confidence"}
The request body may also carry the schema keys "instructions", "samples",
"auto_max", "auto_threshold", "steps", "think", "ask", "chunk_rows",
"chunk_prompt", "sequential", "layout" and "isolate" ("auto", "noul", "none" or "all") as
extensions. Images go ahead of the
state, either as multipart/form-data with the JSON body in a part named
"request" and each image as a file part, or as an "images" array of data
URLs in the JSON body.

POST /v1/chat/completions makes the same decision from an OpenAI-shaped
call. The system message is the schema JSON below and the user message is
the state. The reply's `content` is the JSON answer set.

dgem: POST /v1/raw/chat/completions (plain generation passed to vLLM) is
not served and answers 410: this server returns decisions.

With API_KEY set in the environment, every POST needs "Authorization:
Bearer <key>". --tls-port adds an HTTPS listener with a self-signed
certificate kept in --cert-dir, for clients that need a secure origin.

Each answer is one distribution per question, from one denoise step over a
seeded canvas, averaged over a few noise draws. This server handles the
canvas, tokenizer, slot resolution, noise draws and averaging.

Schema (system message):
  {"questions": [
     {"id": "urgent", "type": "noul", "instructions": "..."},
     {"id": "bucket", "type": "choice", "instructions": "...",
      "options": [{"name": "billing", "description": "..."}, ...]},
     {"id": "tone", "type": "score", "instructions": "...",
      "levels": ["calm", "annoyed", "furious"]}],
   "instructions": "optional context",
   "samples": "auto" | N, "auto_threshold": 0.1, "auto_max": 4,
   "steps": 1, "think": 0}

A question may also declare:
  "depends_on": [ids]        answered after those, with their answers in
                             its prompt
  "ask_if": {id: [answers]}  asked only when that question's answer is
                             among them (a skipped answer is null)
  "alone": true              a read of its own (by default yes/no questions get one in text requests of
                             2-3 questions with 2+ yes/no, DEFAULT_ISOLATE=auto; "isolate": "noul" on the
                             request does it in requests of 2-8 questions; "alone": false keeps one joint)
Questions run in stages by these dependencies. Each stage is one joint
read. Later stages continue the earlier answers, prefilled for a text
state and restated for an image.

Up to ten questions answer as "id: label" lines. Past that the id runs
straight into the label, space separated, one row fewer per question. The
server splits a schema whose answer template does not fit the canvas into
chunks that run together, each with its own question list. "chunk_rows"
sets the rows per chunk, "ask" picks a subset of question ids for one
read, "sequential": true runs the chunks in order with the earlier answers
prefilled, and "chunk_prompt": "shared" lists every question in each
chunk's prompt. "think": N lets the model write up to N tokens in its
thought channel, as an ordinary generation, and the read then runs with
that thought in its prompt. "layout" picks the prompt layout:
"document_first" (the default; env DEFAULT_LAYOUT) sends the state first
and the questions after it, both in the user turn; "schema_first" sends the
questions as the system prompt. With images the model writes the thought with
the image in view and the server seeds it into the canvas ahead of the
answer, so the canvas bounds it. The noise draws of a decision share one
thought.

Serve the model with a canvas that holds the answer template, for example:
  vllm serve google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it \
      --diffusion-config '{"canvas_length": 64}' --max-logprobs 32 \
      --enable-prefix-caching
then run this in front of it:
  python structured_server.py --upstream http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
      --tokenizer google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it --canvas 64 --port 8011
